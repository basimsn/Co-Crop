Sustainability Impact
Co-Crop aims to promote sustainability at both local and global levels. By facilitating the
exchange of locally grown produce, the platform reduces the need for packaged goods
from supermarkets, leading to a decrease in plastic waste at the community level.
Additionally, by encouraging more people to grow their own food, Co-Crop contributes to
global sustainability by reducing the need for long-distance transportation of produce,
thereby lowering overall emissions.
Note: Co-Crop is a project developed using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, pug,
and sqlite3.
